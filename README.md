The Online Office Hour Discord Butler

## Purpose

With the need for online learning becoming increasingly higher, efficient means of reaching educators has become extremely important. 
We implemented a discord bot to help instructors automate the process of their Office Hours through Discord.


We created this bot with the goal of allowing students to effectively communicate with their instructors,
with the option to be able to ask their peers for help while they wait.
   
## Overview 
OH-Bot is a server managment automation bot. This means that tasks like notifying students when they are ready to been seen can be automated 

OH-Bot is a *self-hotsted* bot - meaning that you will need to host and maintain your own instance. 

## Waiting Queue System

There are three roles in the OH-Bot server template:
* Admin - total control of bot functionality and server interfaces
* Instructor - control over OH sessions and locked channels
* Student - ability to interface with OH-Queue


### Commands

* `/open` - Access Role: [Admin, Instructor]
    * Open the OH-queue for students to join using `/eq`
* `/close` - Access Role: [Admin, Instructor]
    * Close the OH-queue, stop students from entering the queue
    * Students that were in the queue before closing will still be regisitered for OH
* `/clear /cq` - Access Role: [Admin, Instructor]
    * Empties the OH-queue of students
* `/enterqueue /eq` - Access Role: [Admin, Instructor, Student]
    * Enter sender into the OH-queue
* `/leavequeue /lq` - Access Role: [Admin, Instructor, Student]
    * Removes sender from the OH-queue
* `/dequeue /dq` - Access Role: [Admin, Instructor]
    * Removes next student from the queue and moves them into the voice channel the sender is currently connected to.
* `/help` - Access Role: [Admin, Instructor]
    * Sends a DM to the sender containing the above commands and their behavior

## Server [Template]()
OH-Bot makes use of Discord's Server Template feature

There are three roles in the OH-Bot server template:
