The Online Office Hour Discord Butler

## Purpose

With the need for online learning becoming increasingly higher, efficient means of reaching educators has become extremely important. 
We implemented a discord bot to help instructors automate the process of their Office Hours through Discord.


We created this bot with the goal of allowing students to effectively communicate with their instructors,
with the option to be able to ask their peers for help while they wait.
   
## Overview 
OH-Bot is a server managment automation bot. This means that tasks like notifying students when they are ready to been seen can be automated 

OH-Bot is a *self-hotsted* bot - meaning that you will need to host and maintain your own instance. 

## Requirements
* Python 3.7 (or higher)
* Discord account


## Waiting Queue System
An instructor can open the OH session by issuing the command `/open`.
