The Online Office Hour Discord Butler

## Purpose

With the need for online learning becoming increasingly higher, efficiency in reaching educators has become 
extremely important. We implemented a discord bot to help instructors automate the process of their Office
Hours through Discord.


We created this bot with the goal of allowing students to effectively communicate with their instructors,
with the option to be able to ask their peers for help while they wait.
   

## Features  

- Waiting Queue System 
- Breakout Rooms
